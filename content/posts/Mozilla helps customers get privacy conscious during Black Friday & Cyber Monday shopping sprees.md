The average "coDesign" reader is, for sure, someone who loves their tech. Mozilla just dropped a new webpage with the best Home Tech, Gaming Consoles, Health Tech, Toys and Gadgets listed under fancy categories. The catch- once you click on a specific product, Mozilla tells you how secure (privacy-wise) the product is.

Know more about the new webpage (or the "guide") through Mozilla's "[Why we Made This Guide](https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/privacynotincluded/why-we-made)" page. Discuss this curation using the embedded commentint system right below.
