Traditionally a writer, Andrea Passwater decided to enter the world of code by creating a serverless application. Read the [original article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-just-deployed-a-serverless-app-and-i-cant-code-here-s-how-i-did-it-94983d7b43bd) in order to read Andrea's documentation. Creating a serverless application for non-coders (and using AWS) is not as hard as it seemed, after all.

As a side-note, this one line is a scumptuous piece of text:

>I used Atom because I do not have a favorite code editor but I do have a favorite unit of matter.
