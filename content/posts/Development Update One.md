Hello there, readers. Welcome to "Development Updates," a series that keeps you folks up-to-date with the progress we're constantly making behind the scenes.

Our target audience is you, the developers and designers that make up for this lovely community, which is why being 100% transparent (on top of Open Sourcing everything on our domain) felt essential. As we haven't even launched our product properly yet (consider this post to be a "soft launch"), there's a lot of stuff on the site right now that you're going to see change.

For starters, we shifted all of our site from Ghost to WordPress to Ghost to Grav CMS to Jekyll to WordPress to Hugo (a static site generator written in Golang)- quite a journey, I know. Hugo is fast, reliable, constantly in development and completely Open Source! We're now hosted on Netlify.

In addition to the updates on the code side of things, we now have an updated look as well. We have new icons and new banners throughout. Also, in addition to Deadmanx XD joining our Design team, CallMeJ and DevanshBajaj have joined us as a developers as well.

We now have a "coDesign Dev" channel, which documents all the changes that are being made to the codebase, which, by the way, anyone and everyone reading this can send a PR to!

<h2>To DO</h2>

At the end of every Development Update, we'll be keeping one section aside for a #ToDo list. Here's the #ToDo list for this issue:

#ToDo

1. Need to add stuff to the Drop-down

2. Need to fix Mobile layout, centre the logo and align the rest of the stuff.

3. Need to add featured images to the left of articles.

4. Need to add one big hero post (latest post at the top) that has a large image with a heading and description.

5. Need to fix images not showing on the /our-team page. Code stylized at min.scss

6. Need to add a comment section powered by Disqus to ONLY the posts that have "Discuss" in their title and their categories array.

7. Need to come up with an easy-to-recognise, non-complex, unique, preferably freeform icon which will also serve as our brand icon.

8. Need to come up with an official banner for social media.

9. Need to add a list of the most popular tags to the left of the posts.
