Are you tired of countless advertisements on websites and blogs? Are you tired of looking at the homepage of a blog only to find articles like “5 Things You Didn’t Know Device X Has” or “8 Surprising and Secret Features of Device Y” in an endless array? Are you as tired as I am of looking at blogs “sourcing” articles from other blogs, just to score the extra reader viewership?

If the answer to even one of the questions above is “yes,” you’re at the right place.

Blogs and publications these days have torrents of words at every nook and corner of their respective layouts. Wherever the eyeball lands, there’s ought to be an unnecessarily hyped article on the “next big thing.” And if you’re too busy to refresh the webpage every few minutes, boy, you’re slated to miss out on the one story that matters.

At coDesign, we unearth those very stories- the stories that you’d rather read- from blogs and publications from all around the Interwebs.

Our team does all the work for you, they browse the internet for qualitative content, find something interesting, run the bulk of discovery through our Editorial Guidelines and curate the content that passes the editorial tests. Sit back, relax, drink a cup of coffee, grab your rubber duck, and follow us on social media to receive notifications for each curation in real-time.

Our project is [100% available through git](https://github.com/coDesign/blog) and 100% open to thoughtful Pull Requests. Also, did I mention the fact that Will Anderson, our Chief Curator happens to have a unique accent he'd be more than happy to tickle your ears to through a weekly podcast that highlights all the curations for the past week?

P.S- We're looking for a co-host for the weekly podcast. If you're interested, contact us via [Telegram](https://t.me/thecodesignpub).

P.P.S- Want to submit a link for our team's reviewal? Head over to- oh, the number of times we've mentioned Telegram has exceeded the number of times a normal person would mention anything, really. You know where to find us :)
