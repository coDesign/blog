A few hours ago, a tweet surfaced onto the Interwebs with a PSA for all macOS users. The tweet, by Lemi Orhan Ergin reveals how ayone can login as "root" with an empty password after clicking on the login button several times.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AppleSupport</a>, we noticed a *HUGE* security issue at MacOS High Sierra. Anyone can login as &quot;root&quot; with empty password after clicking on login button several times. Are you aware of it <a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Apple</a>?</p>&mdash; Lemi Orhan Ergin (@lemiorhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/lemiorhan/status/935578694541770752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Apple did respond to the tweet, asking Lemi to pursue the "complaint" via Twitter Direct Messages. An official statement from Apple, recognising this bug is yet to be seen. Hopefully, there'll be a silent patch out before tomorrow.

We&#39;ll meet up with you there. <a href="https://t.co/GDrqU22YpT">https://t.co/GDrqU22YpT</a></p>&mdash; Apple Support (@AppleSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSupport/status/935605599328497664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

##Update

[9To5Mac published a guide](https://9to5mac.com/2017/11/28/how-to-set-root-password/) on getting around this issue. In the guide, Greg Barbosa outlines an Apple Spokesperson's response recognising this issue as well.

>We are working on a software update to address this issue. In the meantime, setting a root password prevents unauthorized access to your Mac. To enable the Root User and set a password, please follow the instructions here. If a Root User is already enabled, to ensure a blank password is not set, please follow the instructions from the ‘Change the root password’ section.[]()
