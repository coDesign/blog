All of us use applications like Uber, Twitter, Spotify, Snapchat, Tinder and Skype. Quite recently, results from a joint study conducted by Exodus Privacy (A French Non-Profit organisation) and the Privacy Lab at Yale University were published. Apparently, all of the applications mentioned above have been secretly "tracking" us.


Exodus Labs went ahead and [created a webpage](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/trackers/) of all the trackers they could find from scanning the Play Store. In addition, they went ahead and Open-Sourced the Analysis program they used. It's available [here on Github](https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy/exodus).

There's a lot more to this story, it is recommended to go ahead and [read the original article](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/28/android_apps_unexpectedly_track_users/) published by [Richard Chirgwin](https://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/Richard-Chirgwin) at The Register.
